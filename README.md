# SQL-Analysis-on-Instagram
Built a Data Model, Implemented Basic to Advanced SQL Queries

Abstract:
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive data model for a social media platform, consisting of five primary tables: Posts, Comments, Likes, Users, and Followers. The data model is carefully crafted to capture the relationships and interactions between users and their content on the platform. Each table is defined with key attributes to store essential information as shown in the data model diagram.

The implemented data model facilitates the execution of a range of SQL queries, from basic to advanced, to extract meaningful insights from the social media data. Basic queries include retrieving user information, post details, and comment content, while more advanced queries involve aggregating data to compute metrics such as like counts and user rankings. The model is designed to support efficient data retrieval and manipulation, ensuring optimal performance as the social media platform grows in scale.
